Inception
- Obtain Project Charter. (who and why sponsors the initiative)
- Obtain Stakeholders. (positive and negative)
- Obtain Key Objectives.
- Identify Performance Requirements.

Plan
- Obtain high level project plan and key milestones.
- Obtain high level architecture and technology stack.
- Obtain high level volume information (including data volume).
- Obtain high level performance targets. (KPI's / SLA's)
- Define team resources.
- Define infrastructure resources.
- Define load testing scenarios.
- Identify risks, define mitigation and contingency plans.
- Define entry and acceptance criteria for performance testing.
- Create performance testing engagement plan.

Design
- Obtain baseline volume and performance information by either (in order of preference):
> Extracting transactional volume and performance metrics from observability in production.
> Obtaining expected volume from technical architecture or business stakeholders (new applications / features)
> Extrapolating transactional volumes from business analytics, application logs, audit tables...
> Defining volume and metrics expectations with business and technical stakeholders.
- Identify or define a performance testing environment and its scaling to production.
> Define and execute strategy for uniform scaling of system components.
> Define and execute strategy for database uniform and representative data scaling.
- Develop test data strategy. (generation, extraction and / or virtualization).
- Map transactions to user flows.
- Prioritize user flows and transactions, define transactions in scope.
- Define final transaction mix and test flows.

Develop
- Script.
> Record or develop script.
> Conduct parameterization and correlation.
- Validate and refine scripts.
> validate scripts against multiple iterations and concurrent threads.
> validate results against target baseline.
- Create and validate pipeline jobs, integrate to CI / CD platform (optional, recommended)

Execute (iterative)
- Execute and monitor load tests.
- Analyze and report results.
> create defects and validate resolution.
- Support performance optimization and troubleshooting.
- Obtain sign off and define new baseline.
- Close engagement.
